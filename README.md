# stock-prediction-using-regression

Objective: Build 3 different types of regression lines to predict stock prices using Python, then print out the prediction for the best performing one

Run regression.py to view the three regression lines and the actual adjusted closing price for stock: NVDA

All plots generated by regression.py

See the following print outs:

<h2>Lasso Forecast is the best performing one</h2>

<h3>Zoomed in to see the seperation of the Lasso with the linear regression</h3>

<h3>Zoomed in much more to see the seperation of the ridge forecasts with the linear regression forecasts (very simular forecasts)</h3>
